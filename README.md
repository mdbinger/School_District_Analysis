  - The average math score decreased by .1 overall when Thomas High School's 9th graders were removed
  - The average reading score was unaffected when Thomas High School's 9th graders were removed
  - The percent passing math, percent passing reading, and the overall percent passing were all unaffected when Thomas High School's 9th graders were removed
    - There may have been small changes similar to the average math score, but nothing large enough to result in the numbers being unequal when rounded to the nearest whole number as they are in our original district summary. 
  - Overall, it is safe to claim removing the Thomas High School 9th graders from our analysis did not significantly impact our district summary
